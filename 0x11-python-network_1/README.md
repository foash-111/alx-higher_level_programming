The difference between using req = urllib.request.Request(sys.argv[1])
 and directly using with urllib.request.urlopen(sys.argv[1])
  as response: lies in the flexibility and control over the request that Request provides.

Using urllib.request.Request(sys.argv[1]): This approach creates a Request object, which allows you to specify additional parameters such as headers, data, and the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.). This is useful when you need to customize the request beyond just the URL. For example, you might want to add custom headers, send data in a POST request, or specify a different HTTP method. The Request object is flexible and can be used with various types of URLs, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and others.
Directly using urllib.request.urlopen(sys.argv[1]): This approach is simpler and is suitable for basic GET requests where no customization is needed. It directly opens the URL and returns a response object. This method is less flexible compared to using Request because it does not allow for easy customization of the request. However, it is sufficient for simple scenarios where you only need to retrieve data from a URL without modifying the request.
In summary, if you need to customize the request (e.g., adding headers, changing the HTTP method, or sending data), use urllib.request.Request. For straightforward GET requests without customization, urllib.request.urlopen suffices.

and what about this:
 response = requests.get("https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/status")
ANSWER | PHIND INSTANT MODEL
The line response = requests.get("https://alx-intranet.hbtn.io/status") uses the requests library to send a GET request to the specified URL and assigns the response to the variable response. This is a high-level, user-friendly way to make HTTP requests in Python, offering several advantages over using urllib directly:

Simplicity: The requests library abstracts away many of the complexities involved in making HTTP requests, providing a simple and intuitive API. For example, to send a GET request, you simply call requests.get(url).
Automatic Decoding: When you receive a response, requests automatically decodes the content to UTF-8, making it easier to work with text-based responses without needing to manually decode them.
Error Handling: requests provides built-in error handling for common HTTP errors, making it easier to write robust code that can gracefully handle errors like timeouts, network issues, or invalid URLs.
Support for JSON: requests makes it easy to work with JSON data. You can automatically convert the response content to a Python dictionary using .json().
