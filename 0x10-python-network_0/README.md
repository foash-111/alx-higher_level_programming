how i know what the http methods that server will accept?

To determine which HTTP methods are accepted by a server,
you can use the OPTIONS method. The OPTIONS method requests information about the communication options available for the target resource.

You can use curl to send an OPTIONS request to the server and inspect the response headers. Here's how you can do it:
curl -X OPTIONS -I [URL]
Replace [URL] with the URL of the server you want to check. For example:

bash:
curl -X OPTIONS -I https://example.com
The server will respond with a list of allowed methods in the Allow header. For instance:
<ouput>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Allow: GET, HEAD, POST, OPTIONS

In this example, the server allows the GET, HEAD, POST, and OPTIONS methods.
This means you can use any of these methods to interact with the resource.

If the server does not support the OPTIONS method, it may respond with a "405 Method Not Allowed" status code, indicating that the method is not allowed for the target resource.
